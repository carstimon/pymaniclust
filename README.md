# pymaniclust

Code for k-means optimization using manifold optimization.

The class Y_mani holds a [Pymanopt](https://pymanopt.github.io/) manifold which is a continuous relaxation of a discrete set of clustering matrices.

Another central class is Cluster_Pblm which holds information about a clustering problem of points in RR^d.

example.py holds an example of how the code runs.
